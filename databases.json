[{"question": "What is normalization in database design?", "answer": "Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS) in a computer system?", "answer": "A DBMS is software that facilitates the creation, organization, and management of databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the data, ensures data integrity, and supports efficient data retrieval."}, {"question": "Explain the difference between a relational database and a non-relational (NoSQL) database.", "answer": "Relational databases use a structured schema and are based on the principles of the relational model, whereas NoSQL databases can have flexible or schema-less structures and support various data models."}, {"question": "What is normalization, and why is it important in database design?", "answer": "Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing tables into smaller, related tables. It ensures data integrity and reduces the chances of anomalies."}, {"question": "Discuss the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.", "answer": "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure that database transactions are reliable, consistent, and recoverable in the event of failures."}, {"question": "Explain the concept of indexing in databases and its impact on query performance.", "answer": "Indexing involves creating a data structure to enhance the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It accelerates query performance by allowing the database engine to quickly locate the rows matching a condition."}, {"question": "What is a foreign key in a relational database, and how does it establish relationships between tables?", "answer": "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity."}, {"question": "Discuss the differences between OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) databases.", "answer": "OLAP databases are designed for complex queries and reporting, focusing on analysis, while OLTP databases are optimized for fast, real-time transaction processing and data modifications."}, {"question": "What is a stored procedure in a database, and how does it differ from a function?", "answer": "A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database. It can include procedural logic. A function, on the other hand, returns a single value and is typically used in queries."}, {"question": "Explain the purpose of data warehousing in the context of databases.", "answer": "Data warehousing involves the collection, storage, and management of data from different sources to support business intelligence and decision-making. It provides a centralized repository for historical and current data."}, {"question": "What is the CAP theorem, and how does it impact the design of distributed databases?", "answer": "The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can provide at most two out of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. It influences the design trade-offs in distributed databases."}, {"question": "Explain the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.", "answer": "ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability."}]
