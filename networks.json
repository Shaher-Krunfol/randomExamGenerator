    {"question": "Define the OSI model and its layers.", "answer": "The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication or computing system into seven abstraction layers."},
    {"question": "Explain the difference between a hub, switch, and router in a computer network.", "answer": "A hub operates at the physical layer and simply repeats signals to all connected devices. A switch operates at the data link layer and intelligently forwards frames based on MAC addresses. A router operates at the network layer and routes data between different networks."},
    {"question": "What is the purpose of the Domain Name System (DNS) in computer networks?", "answer": "DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using names rather than numerical IP addresses."},
    {"question": "Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of wired and wireless networks.", "answer": "Wired networks offer higher speed and reliability, while wireless networks provide greater flexibility and convenience. However, wireless networks may be susceptible to interference and have limited range."},
    {"question": "What is the function of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in network communication?", "answer": "TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between devices on a network. It provides error checking, flow control, and congestion control."},
    {"question": "Explain the concept of subnetting in computer networking.", "answer": "Subnetting involves dividing an IP network into sub-networks to improve performance and security. It allows for efficient use of IP addresses and reduces broadcast traffic."},
    {"question": "What is a firewall, and how does it enhance network security?", "answer": "A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks."},
    {"question": "Discuss the role of the OSI model in understanding network protocols.", "answer": "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It helps in understanding and designing network protocols."},
    {"question": "What is a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network), and how does it improve network segmentation?", "answer": "A VLAN is a logical grouping of devices within a local area network, even if they are not physically connected. It enhances network segmentation, providing better control and security."},
    {"question": "Explain the purpose of NAT (Network Address Translation) in computer networking.", "answer": "NAT is a technique that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address. It enhances security and conserves public IP addresses."},
    {"question": "Discuss the differences between a hub and a switch in terms of network performance and collision domain.", "answer": "A hub operates at the physical layer and creates a single collision domain, causing network congestion. A switch operates at the data link layer and creates separate collision domains for each port, improving network performance."}
