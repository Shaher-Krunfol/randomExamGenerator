    {"question": "What is the Von Neumann architecture?", "answer": "It is a computer architecture design that uses a single data bus for both instructions and data."},
    {"question": "What is the Harvard architecture, and how does it differ from the Von Neumann architecture?", "answer": "The Harvard architecture has separate memory spaces for data and instructions, unlike the Von Neumann architecture, which uses a single memory space for both."},
    {"question": "Explain the concept of cache memory in computer architecture and its role in improving performance.", "answer": "Cache memory is a small, high-speed type of volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to a processor and stores frequently used computer programs, applications, and data."},
    {"question": "What is the purpose of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in a CPU?", "answer": "The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations on the data received from memory and input devices. It is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU)."},
    {"question": "Define pipelining in the context of computer architecture and discuss its advantages.", "answer": "Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution. It improves throughput and allows for more efficient use of the CPU."},
    {"question": "Explain the role of the Memory Management Unit (MMU) in computer architecture.", "answer": "The MMU is responsible for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses during the process of memory access. It plays a crucial role in virtual memory systems."},
    {"question": "What are RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) and CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) architectures, and how do they differ?", "answer": "RISC architectures use a small set of simple instructions, while CISC architectures use a larger set of more complex instructions. The goal of RISC is to provide more efficient execution of instructions."},
    {"question": "Discuss the concept of Endianness in computer architecture.", "answer": "Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in computer memory. Big-endian systems store the most significant byte first, while little-endian systems store the least significant byte first."},
    {"question": "What is a microprocessor, and how does it differ from a microcontroller?", "answer": "A microprocessor is the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, while a microcontroller includes a CPU, memory, and input/output peripherals on a single chip."},
    {"question": "Describe the concept of parallel processing in computer architecture.", "answer": "Parallel processing involves the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions or processes to achieve faster computational speed. It can be achieved through multi-core processors or distributed computing."},
    {"question": "Explain the concept of instruction pipelining and its stages in a CPU.", "answer": "Instruction pipelining breaks down the execution of instructions into stages, such as instruction fetch, decode, execute, and write back. Each stage is handled by a different segment of the CPU."}
