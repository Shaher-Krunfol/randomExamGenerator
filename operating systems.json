        {"question": "Explain the difference between multitasking and multiprocessing.", "answer": "Multitasking involves executing multiple tasks concurrently on a single processor, while multiprocessing involves using multiple processors to execute tasks concurrently."},
        {"question": "What is the role of the kernel in an operating system?", "answer": "The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources, such as memory, CPU, and I/O devices, and provides essential services for software applications."},
        {"question": "Explain the difference between a process and a thread in the context of operating systems.", "answer": "A process is an independent program in execution, while a thread is a lightweight, smaller unit within a process that shares the same resources but has its own execution path."},
        {"question": "What is a file system, and how does it facilitate data storage in operating systems?", "answer": "A file system is a method used by an operating system to organize and store files on storage devices. It provides a hierarchical structure for data storage and retrieval."},
        {"question": "Discuss the purpose of virtual memory in operating systems.", "answer": "Virtual memory is a memory management technique that uses both RAM and disk space to provide the illusion of a larger memory space. It allows running processes to use more memory than is physically available."},
        {"question": "Explain the concept of deadlock in operating systems and methods to prevent it.", "answer": "Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. Prevention methods include deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection."},
        {"question": "What is a device driver, and why is it essential in operating systems?", "answer": "A device driver is a specialized program that allows the operating system to communicate with and control hardware devices. It serves as an interface between the operating system and hardware components."},
        {"question": "Discuss the role of the shell in an operating system.", "answer": "The shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. It interprets user commands and executes them on behalf of the user."},
        {"question": "What is process scheduling, and how does it impact the performance of an operating system?", "answer": "Process scheduling is the technique used by an operating system to manage the execution of processes. Efficient scheduling improves system responsiveness and resource utilization."},
        {"question": "Explain the concept of demand paging in virtual memory systems.", "answer": "Demand paging is a technique where pages of a process are only loaded into memory when they are requested, reducing the initial memory requirements and allowing for more efficient use of resources."},
        {"question": "Discuss the differences between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling in operating systems.", "answer": "Preemptive scheduling allows the operating system to interrupt a currently running process, while non-preemptive scheduling does not interrupt processes until they voluntarily release control."}
